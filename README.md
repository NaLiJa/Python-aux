# Python-aux

Auxiliary libraries needed for Python3 compilation, precompiled (libpng, harfbuzz, freetype...). They can be useful for many other OpenSource projects on iOS, too.

## How to use: 

In your Xcode project, use the menu File -> "Swift Packages" -> "Add Package Dependency". In the window that opens, enter the address for this repository (https://github.com/holzschu/Python-aux.git). 

In the rightmost column, you will see "Swift Package Dependencies", and under it "Python-aux". Under "Referenced Binaries", you have all the libraries, precompiled, as "xcframework". You can link with them, embed them, and Xcode will extract the iOS or Simulator version as needed.

## How to compile: 

TODO.
